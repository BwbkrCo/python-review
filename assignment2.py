# Loops and Conditionals Assignment 

# 1) Create a list of names and use a for loop to output the length of each name (len() ).
names = ["Lena", "Brian", "Jeff", "David", "Eric", "Adrian", "Cyrus", "Bea", "Nina"]
for i in range(len(names)):
    # print(len(names[i]))

    # 2) Add an if check inside the loop to only output names longer than 5 characters.
    if len(names[i]) > 5:
        print(names[i])
    
    # 3) Add another if check to see whether a name includes a “n”  or “N”  character.
    


# 4) Use a while  loop to empty the list of names (via pop() )
