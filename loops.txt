Loops 

for Loop

for element in list:
    print(element)

A for Loop allows you to interate through the elements of an iterable (e.g. a List)
Changing the iterable as part of the Loop is NOT recommended

white Loop

while True:
    print('Ifinity!')

A while Loop allows you to repeat code as long as its condition is True.
Make sure to provide an exit condition otherwise CTRL + Z has to be used.

Use "break" to exit the Loop before it's finished
Use "continue" to skip an iteration
