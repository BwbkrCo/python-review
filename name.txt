What's a blockchain?
A distributed data storage consisting of containers (blocks) which are connected. 


What's a cryptocurrency?
If the data you store in a block is a list of transactions, the coins transferred in the 
transactions form your cryptocurrency. 

Where are the Coins?
Coins are transferred with Transactions.
Changing them into other currencies is no possible inside the blockchain.
- The value ofa coin is determined by the value the participants of the blockchain network assign to it. 
(i.e. what you're willing to pay in "real" currencies). 
Coins are created via Mining (as a reward for the effort).
